Overview
========

This project is based on Signal Performance Metric data from Seminole County, Florida. The purpose is to apply [Spark Python API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) to analyze the dataset. The size of the testing dataset is quite small (covering only one selected hour), but the framework should apply for dataset with longer time period. 

The analysis include:

-   Build cluster in Linux system based on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
-   Reading and writing data using Google Cloud Storage (Buckets)
-   Utilized [Spark SQL module](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) for structured data processing
